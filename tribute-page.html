        Her Story
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mary McLeod Bethune was an educator and activist, serving as president of the National Association of Colored Women and founding the National Council of Negro Women.</li>

        <li>Born Mary Jane McLeod on July 10, 1875, in Mayesville, South Carolina. She grew up in poverty, one of 17 children born to formerly enslaved parents, Samuel and Patsy McLeod. Bethune became the one and only child in her family to go to school when a missionary opened a school nearby for African American children.</li>

        <li>Bethune later received a scholarship to the Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College), a school for girls in Concord, North Carolina. After graduating from the seminary in 1893, she went to the Dwight Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions (also known as Moody Bible Institute) in Chicago. Bethune completed her studies there two years later. Returning to the South, she began her career as a teacher.</li>

        <li>For nearly a decade, Bethune worked as an educator. She married fellow teacher Albertus Bethune in 1898. The couple had one son together—Albert Mcleod Bethune—before ending their marriage in 1907.</li>

        <li>Bethune founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls in Daytona, Florida, in 1904. Starting out with only five students, she helped grow the school to more 250 students over the next years. She believed that education provided the key to racial advancement.</li>

        <li>Bethune served as the school's president, and she remained its leader through merging with the Cookman Institute for Men in 1923 (some sources say 1929). The merged institution became known as the Bethune-Cookman College. The college was one of the few places that African American students could pursue a college degree. Bethune stayed with the college until 1942.</li>

        <li>In addition to her work at the school, Bethune did much to contribute to American society at large. She served as the president of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Colored Women for many years. In 1924, Bethune became the organization's national leader.</li>

        <li>Bethune also became involved in government service, lending her expertise to several presidents. President Calvin Coolidge invited her to participate in a conference on child welfare. For President Herbert Hoover, she served on Commission on Home Building and Home Ownership and was appointed to a committee on child health. But her most significant roles in public service came from President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</li>

        <li>In 1935, Bethune became a special advisor to President Roosevelt on minority affairs. That same year, she also started up her own civil rights organization, the National Council of Negro Women. Bethune created this organization to represent numerous groups working on critical issues for African-American women.</li>

        <li>In 1936, she was appointed to the director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration by President Roosevelt. One of her main concerns in this position was helping young people find job opportunities. In addition to her official role in the Roosevelt administration, Bethune became a trusted friend and adviser to both the president and his wife Eleanor Roosevelt.</li>

        <li> After leaving Bethune-Cookman College in 1942, Bethune spent much of the rest of her life devoted to social causes. She took up residence at its new National Council of Negro Women headquarters in a Washington, D.C.</li>

        <li>An early member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she helped represent the group at the 1945 conference on the founding of the United Nations along with W.E.B. DuBois.</li>

        <li>In the early 1950s, President Harry Truman appointed her to a committee on national defense and appointed her to serve as an official delegate to a presidential inauguration in Liberia.</li>

        <li>Eventually returning to Florida in her retirement, Bethune died on May 18, 1955, in Daytona.</li>

        <li>Bethune penned "My Last Will and Testament," which served as a reflection on her own life and legacy in addition to addressing a few estate matters. She wrote <b>"I leave you a thirst for education. Knowledge is the prime need of the hour."</b> Bethune closed with <b>"If I have a legacy to leave my people, it is my philosophy of living and serving.",</b></li>
